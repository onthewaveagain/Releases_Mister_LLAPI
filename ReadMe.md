This is an alternative repository to the official MiSTer LLAPI repository.
It is a fork of MiSTer official cores. LLAPI implementation has been ported from the original LLAPI github.
This has been done during my spare time. I still need to figure out how to automate a little the process of updating the cores in order to keep up with the MiSTer developments.

If you want to contribute, please contact me.
